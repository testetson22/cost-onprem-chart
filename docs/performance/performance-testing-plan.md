## Executive Summary

This document outlines the performance testing strategy for Cost Management On-Premise deployments. Performance testing will validate:

1. **Ingestion throughput** - How fast can data be uploaded and processed?
2. **Scale limits** - How many clusters/sources can be managed?
3. **Resource efficiency** - Are resource allocations appropriate?
4. **Latency** - API response times under various loads

---

## Architecture Overview (Performance-Critical View)

From FLPATH-4036:

```
Cost Management On-Premise processes OpenShift cluster cost and resource 
optimization data through a multi-stage pipeline:

  Ingestion (insights-ingress-go)
      ↓
  Cost Processing (koku/MASU + Celery workers)
      ↓
  Resource Optimization (ros-ocp-backend + Kruize)
      ↓
  Storage (PostgreSQL + Valkey)
```

Current Helm chart deploys all components with **conservative defaults** (single replicas, low resource limits) without validated sizing guidance.

---

## Known Bottlenecks

### From Existing Documentation

| Component | Role | Constraint | Reference |
|-----------|------|------------|-----------|
| **Koku Listener** | Processes uploaded CSV files | Single-threaded, serial Kafka consumer | `iqe-testing-setup.md` |
| **Celery Workers** | Background summarization tasks | Queue-based, depends on worker count | `resource-requirements.md` |
| **PostgreSQL** | Cost data storage & queries | Query complexity, connection pooling | `resource-requirements.md` |
| **Kafka** | Message queue for uploads | Topic partitions, broker count | `deploy-kafka.sh` |
| **Ingress** | File upload API | Upload size limits (100MB default) | `configuration.md` |

### Measured Performance (from test runs)

```
Listener Throughput:
- Processes files serially via single Kafka consumer
- CPU-bound (parquet conversion, SQL insertion)
- Default CPU limit throttles processing
- Boosting to 4 cores = ~40-50% faster processing

Source Processing Time:
- Small static source (1 month, no GPU): 30-60s
- Dynamic daily source (3 months, 6 CSVs/month): 2-5 min
```

---

## Scenario Definitions (from FLPATH-4036)

### Workload Density

OCP uploads cost data daily (24h reporting window, typically 288 intervals at 5-min granularity per pod).

### Row Count Formula

```
daily_rows = pods × 288 intervals/day × (pod_usage + storage_usage factor ~1.0)
monthly_rows = daily_rows × 30
upload_size = ~43 bytes/CSV row compressed at ~10:1 ratio
```

### Cluster Profiles (from Pau Garcia Quiles - Production Data April 2026)

Based on production metrics snapshot covering 417 active OCP accounts.
Resource sizing per profile is maintained in [sizing-guide.md](sizing-guide.md).

| Profile | % of Customers | Clusters | Nodes | CPU Cores | Memory | PVCs | Cost Models |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------|-----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Small** | 37% | 1 | 15 | 200 | 1.1 TB | 48 | 1 (CPU dist) |
| **Medium** | 35% | 2 | 49 | 544 | 2.8 TB | 177 | 1 (CPU dist) |
| **Large** | 21% | 7 | 133 | 1,964 | 9.7 TB | 492 | 1-2 (CPU dist) |
| **Extra-Large** | 6% | 23 | 346 | 6,954 | 48.5 TB | 1,255 | 1-3 (CPU dist + tag rates) |

**Key Production Insights**:
- 39% of customers have single cluster, 72% have ≤4 clusters
- Control plane: universally 3 nodes per cluster
- Typical node: 16 cores / 63 GB RAM (median)
- 71% of accounts use cost models; adoption increases with size (100% at XL)
- CPU distribution is dominant cost model feature (58%); tag rates rare (9.4%)

**Stress/Edge-Case Values (P99/Max)**:
| Metric | P99 | Max |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Clusters | 33 | 67 |
| Nodes | 1,072 | 4,311 |
| CPU Cores | 57,424 | 793,424 |
| PVCs | 6,099 | 32,443 |
| Cost Models | 7 | 12 |

### Multi-Cluster Scenarios

Each cluster gets a unique `cluster_id` and `source_id`. Data generation produces separate payloads per cluster.

| Scenario | Clusters | Profile per Cluster | Total Pods | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| Single Small | 1 | Small | TBD | Baseline |
| Multi Small | 5 | Small | TBD | Small fleet |
| Single Large | 1 | Large | TBD | Enterprise single |
| Multi Mixed | 10 | Mixed | TBD | Realistic fleet |

---

## Data Generation Design (from FLPATH-4036)

### Tooling: NISE (koku-nise)

NISE is the existing data generation tool used by E2E tests. It generates proper OCP cost CSVs with `manifest.json`.

### QE Approach: Leverage Existing Infrastructure

> **Note**: PR #144 proposes standalone bash scripts (`generate-test-data.sh`, `upload-test-data.sh`). From a QE/test automation perspective, we should leverage the **existing pytest/NISE integration** rather than creating parallel tooling:

| Existing Infrastructure | Location | Use For Performance Tests |
|------------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| `NISEConfig` class | `tests/e2e_helpers.py` | Configure scenario parameters |
| `generate_nise_data()` | `tests/e2e_helpers.py` | Generate test data |
| `upload_with_retry()` | `tests/e2e_helpers.py` | Upload to ingress |
| `register_source()` | `tests/e2e_helpers.py` | Source registration |
| `create_upload_package_from_files()` | `tests/utils.py` | Package payloads |
| NISE templates | `tests/data/nise_templates/` | Scenario definitions |

**Recommended approach**:
1. Create scenario YAML files for S1-S11, M1-M6 profiles
2. Use pytest fixtures to generate and upload data
3. Use `@pytest.mark.performance` marker for performance tests
4. Integrate with existing CI/reporting infrastructure

This ensures:
- Consistent tooling across functional and performance tests
- JWT auth handled by existing fixtures
- JUnit XML output for CI integration
- No duplication of NISE/upload logic

### Static Report Configuration

NISE static report YAML defines workloads. Scenario profiles (S1-S11) are being generated as part of PR #144 under `scripts/perf/scenarios/`.

### Upload Frequency Simulation

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Real-world | Every 6 hours (4x/day) | Baseline validation |
| Accelerated | Every 1 minute | Simulate backlog processing |
| Spike | 24 uploads simultaneously | Simulate 6 days of backlog |

### 7-Day Soak: Operational Guide

The 1-hour soak validates test logic; a 7-day run validates production stability
(SC-5). A 7-day pytest process **cannot run from a local machine** — VPN drops,
SSH timeouts, and laptop sleeps will kill it.

#### Industry Patterns (Red Hat / OpenShift)

Research across Red Hat projects shows three patterns for long-running stability
testing. **None use sidecars or in-cluster Jobs for soak tests.**

| Pattern | Used by | How it works |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Periodic CI trigger** | Karpenter, K8s upstream, OpenShift TRT | Short test runs on a schedule against a long-lived cluster. Stability measured by trends across runs, not within a single run. |
| **Loop script on stable host** | OLM v1 (`run_e2e.py`) | Python script loops for N days, running the test binary every M seconds from a bastion/hypervisor. Publishes results to Slack/Google Sheets/S3. |
| **In-cluster Job** | Rare for soak; mostly batch workloads | Single Kubernetes Job running pytest. Fragile — crash at day 5 loses state; log rotation limits visibility. |

The **loop script on stable host** pattern is the best fit for us. Our hypervisors
are always on, have `kubeconfig` access, and aren't affected by VPN. The test
logic (analysis, assertions, JWT refresh) is already in the pytest tests. We
just need a thin outer loop and S3 checkpoint persistence.

#### Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Hypervisor (kni@<host>)                     │
│  soak-loop.sh --background (nohup-based)     │

│      1. run-pytest.sh --perf-soak            │

│  Pull from any machine — no VPN required     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each checkpoint contains the iteration's `SoakTestState` snapshot: upload/query
counts, error list, memory/disk/queue samples, and elapsed time. On completion,
a final summary with aggregate analysis across all iterations is published.

Monitoring is as simple as pulling the latest checkpoint from S3 — no VPN, no
`kubectl`, no SSH required.

#### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Dedicated cluster** | No other workloads should share the cluster during the soak |
| **Stable deployment** | Deploy with `--sizing-profile medium` (or target profile) first |
| **Hypervisor access** | SSH to the machine hosting the cluster (always-on, unaffected by VPN) |
| **No scheduled jobs** | Disable any cron-based cluster operations that could interfere |

#### Execution

`soak-loop.sh` does not depend on `screen`/`tmux` being installed on the
hypervisor. Use its built-in `--background` flag, which daemonizes itself
via `nohup` + `disown` — the loop survives the SSH session ending, and there
is no need to reattach to anything. (If `screen` or `tmux` happen to be
available, running it inside one works too, but it's not required.)

```bash
ssh kni@<hypervisor>
export KUBECONFIG=/home/kni/clusterconfigs/auth/kubeconfig_ocp-edge94
cd /path/to/cost-onprem-chart

# 7-day soak: 1-hour iterations, checkpoint to S3 after each.
# --background returns immediately once the loop is launched.
SOAK_TESTS=true SOAK_DURATION_HOURS=1 \
  ./scripts/soak-loop.sh --days 7 --background \
  --s3-bucket eco-bucket-perf-scale \
  --s3-endpoint https://minio-s3-ecosystem-qe-ai--pipeline.apps.gpc.ocp-hub.prod.psi.redhat.com

# You can safely exit the SSH session now — the loop keeps running.
```

```bash
# Reconnect later to check on it
ssh kni@<hypervisor>
tail -50 /tmp/soak-loop.log          # recent progress
kill -0 $(cat /tmp/soak-loop.pid)    # exits 0 if still running

# Stop gracefully after the current iteration finishes
touch /tmp/soak-stop

# Force kill (last resort — skips final summary)
kill $(cat /tmp/soak-loop.pid)
```

```bash
# Monitor from any machine via S3
aws s3 ls s3://eco-bucket-perf-scale/soak-runs/<run-id>/
aws s3 cp s3://eco-bucket-perf-scale/soak-runs/<run-id>/checkpoint-latest.json -
```

#### Monitoring Checklist (check daily)

- [ ] **S3 checkpoint** — pull latest, verify upload/query counts incrementing and error count low
- [ ] `kubectl get pods -n cost-onprem` — all pods Running, no CrashLoopBackOff
- [ ] `kubectl top pods -n cost-onprem` — no pod near its memory limit
- [ ] `oc adm top nodes` — no node at >90% memory
- [ ] DB disk: `kubectl exec -n cost-onprem cost-onprem-database-0 -- df -h /var/lib/pgsql/data`

#### Implementation Status

- [x] Test code hardened and validated (1-hour, 4/4 passed)
- [x] Condensed mode for rapid iteration
- [x] JWT token refresh for long-running workers
- [x] Jenkins parameters wired (`SOAK_TESTS`, `SOAK_CONDENSED`, `SOAK_DURATION_HOURS`)
- [x] `soak-loop.sh` wrapper script (outer loop, S3 checkpoints, stop signal)
- [x] S3 checkpoint publishing (JSON checkpoints per iteration + final summary)

### Validated Profiles

### Running Performance Tests

```bash
# Via the deploy script (recommended — handles profile config, metrics, S3 upload)
./scripts/deploy-test-cost-onprem.sh \
    --skip-deploy --perf-only \
    --perf-profile xlarge --perf-suite all \
    --listener-cpu max --collect-metrics --upload-metrics

# Direct pytest (requires manual profile config)
PERF_PROFILE=medium pytest -m performance tests/suites/performance/

# Specific suite
PERF_PROFILE=xlarge pytest -m "performance and ingestion" tests/suites/performance/

# Stress tests — all, ramp only, or recovery only
./scripts/deploy-test-cost-onprem.sh --perf-only --perf-profile medium --perf-suite stress
./scripts/deploy-test-cost-onprem.sh --perf-only --perf-profile medium --perf-suite stress_ramp
./scripts/deploy-test-cost-onprem.sh --perf-only --perf-profile medium --perf-suite stress_recovery

# Soak tests (opt-in — condensed ~15 min, or 1h/7d standard)
SOAK_TESTS=true SOAK_CONDENSED=true \
  ./scripts/deploy-test-cost-onprem.sh --perf-only --perf-suite soak --listener-cpu none
SOAK_TESTS=true SOAK_DURATION_HOURS=1 \
  ./scripts/deploy-test-cost-onprem.sh --perf-only --perf-suite soak --listener-cpu none

# Via Jenkins
# Job: flightpath-insights-onprem (RUN_PERF_TESTS=true, PERF_PROFILE=xlarge, PERF_SUITE=all)
```

## Success Criteria Status

| ID | Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|----|----------|--------|----------|
| SC-1 | Sizing table | **Done** | [sizing-guide.md](./sizing-guide.md) — small through xlarge validated |
| SC-2 | Cluster count limits | **Done** | XLarge (23 clusters) validated; stress ramp tested at medium (75), large (100), xlarge (100+) concurrent sources |
| SC-3 | Bottleneck analysis | **Done** | [FINDINGS.md](./FINDINGS.md) — 13 findings documented with severity and evidence |
| SC-4 | Processing window | **Partial** | XLarge completes in ~2h; need to validate against 6-hour SLA formally |
| SC-5 | Soak test | **Partial** | 1-hour soak validated (4/4 passed, COST-7634). Condensed mode available for rapid iteration. 7-day run pending dedicated cluster time. |

## Next Steps

1. [x] Run medium profile for a clean validated baseline (target: 0 failures) — 28/28 api+ingestion, 4/4 ros passed
2. [x] Execute stress ramp-to-failure across medium, large, xlarge — breaking points identified (75, 100, 100+ sources)
3. [x] Soak tests hardened and validated (COST-7634) — 1-hour run passes, condensed mode for rapid iteration
   - [ ] Execute 7-day soak test — requires dedicated cluster time
4. [x] Publish sizing profile overlays + operator mapping draft (COST-7618) — see `cost-onprem/values-*.yaml` and `operator-profile-crd-mapping.md`
5. [x] File tickets for untracked findings — FLPATH-4428 (013), FLPATH-4429 (020), FLPATH-4430 (022), FLPATH-4431 (024)
